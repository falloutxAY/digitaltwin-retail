- Camera/sensor network in the back of house (inventory, storage, pick/pack, asset protection)...and assets (robotics, pallet jacks, etc...refrigeration, etc)
- many of the 'assets' or agents can be anywhere...represent the relationship so that a camera or IoT sensor could be in the ceiling, over the cashwrap, on the shelf/aisle...at curbside/drivethru (license plate)... and even mobile)...so think about a persona of an associate and customer too... they also have telemetry
- need to represent back of house (backroom) versus front of house
- Retail also includes the facility management. Need to have view of HVAC etc. 


## Questions
- How to represent query which are at different levels of the graph. Camera isPartOf checkout area. Camera can also be part of store. Do we create all the relationships or let the query travese down the the graph?
